### Education

I did my undergrad at Cornell in Computer Science and Math, and my Masters at Cornell focused on Machine Learning under [Madeleine Udell](https://people.orie.cornell.edu/mru8/)

At Cornell, I lead the [Cornell University Unmanned Air Systems team](https://cuair.org/) (CUAir). CUAir is a student-lead team with 70+ students accross disciplines that designs, builds and manufactures an autonomous aerial vehicle. We have won four first in missions at the [AUVSI SUAS Competition](https://suas-competition.org/), the largest collegeate autonomous aircraft competition in the US. As lead I was responsible for overall system design (software and hardware), flight testing, recruiting efforts (we had hundreds of applicants per year), alumni relations, sponsorships and interfacing with the college. 

### Publications
- [Online Mixed Missing Value Imputation Using Gaussian Copula](https://openreview.net/forum?id=ELfPj3k6vMM) (tied for highest rated paper in ICML ARTEMISS workshop)
- [Online Missing Value Imputation and Change Point Detection with the Gaussian Copula](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/20906) (selected for oral presentation at AAAI 2022)
- [Reflection Mechanisms as an Alignment target: A survey](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XyBWkoaqfnuEyNWXi/reflection-mechanisms-as-an-alignment-target-a-survey-1)

### Work Experience
I currently work at Meta on large scale Machine Learning for Ads Ranking. I have worked on variety of problems ranging from AutoML for large-scale model retraining, efficient feature representations through quantization, and microservice design for internal tools.

Previously I interned at Meta researching fast approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems on graphs, such as weighted set cover and node-weighted steiner tree/steiner arborescence using Integer Linear Programs (ILPs), meta-heuristic search, and other other approaches.


### Interests
I am interested broadly in Deep Learning, as well as technical, philosophical, and social problems related to the creation of safe Artifical General Intelligence (AGI) that is aligned with human values
