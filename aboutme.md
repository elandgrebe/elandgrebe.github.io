### Education

I did my undergrad at Cornell in Computer Science and Math, and my Masters at Cornell focused on Machine Learning under [Madeleine Udell](https://people.orie.cornell.edu/mru8/)

At Cornell, I lead the [Cornell University Unmanned Air Systems Team](https://cuair.org/). CUAir is a student-lead team with 70+ students accross disciplines that designs, builds and manufactures an autonomous aerial vehicle. We have won four first in missions at the [AUVSI SUAS Competition](https://suas-competition.org/), the largest collegeate autonomous aircraft competition in the US. As lead I was responsible for overall system design (software and hardware), flight testing, recruiting efforts (we had hundreds of applicants per year), alumni relations, sponsorships and interfacing with the college.
